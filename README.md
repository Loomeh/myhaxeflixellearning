This is the source code for my demo "hhgregg is swag". The code is simple and is easy to follow and recreate.

If you would like to see the demo it can be seen on Newgrounds: https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/777650

If you're reading this I'm assuming you already have everything setup. If not then watch this: https://bit.ly/3sofPTJ (Make sure you use Visual Studio Code)

Compiling
---------
Method 1 - Visual Studio Code:

Right click in the directory you unzipped the project in and click "Open with Code". When it's open press Ctrl+Shift+B and it will automatically compile and open.

Method 2 - Command Prompt:

Open CMD as Administrator and cd into the project directory. Then type ``lime test html5 --connect 6000`` and press Enter. It should do the same thing as the VSC method.
